# Evolution Studio Rules of Engagement
- **Storage**: Always work in /mnt/scratch/projects/evolution-studio-mcp.
- **Hardware**: You are running on a Samsung 990 PRO; expect high performance.
- **Vault**: Use the @vault tool for long-term project memory located at /mnt/scratch/vault.
- **Safety**: Never touch the /home or /mnt/c (HP SSD) directories.
